# TED听力拓展2|电子位置的不确定性

发现了一个系列：[1000集 TED-ED](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gf4y1y7wc?p=1&vd_source=4a83c831c5458c234bb7ce23c54c2b63)，感觉都挺合适练听力的，就不用在TED talks里来回翻了。根据合集里的视频我到官网去搜索出来练习（因为官网的字幕可以屏蔽、单语、双语）。本篇为第一集。

- 第一遍：不开弹幕，不开字幕，不按暂停。

  感觉不是很好，大致知道他要说原子模型和电子的不确定性，但是一些句子听不懂。

- 第二遍：开英语字幕，不按暂停。

  发现第一遍听不懂的词语大多数原子物理、化学方面的生词，就没怎么听过它们的发音，大致理解每句话在说什么了。

- 第三遍，开中文字幕，按暂停，整理词汇。

  - stuff 东西

  - particle 粒子

  - proton 质子（其实这里用定语从句介绍了proton是带正电的粒子）at least one positively charged particle,called proton.

  - neutral 中立的

  - neutrons 中子

  - nucleus 原子核

  - identity of an atom一个原子的特性。

  - Indulge me in a momentary tangent.请允许我讲会儿题外话。

    这里我放慢听了很多遍，me和in a的连读真的太可怕了。

  - weird 奇怪

  - quirk 怪癖

  - pinpoint 定位

  - orbitals 轨道

  - density 密集  密度

  - Past a certain distance from the nucleus, the probability of finding an electron starts to decrease more or less exponentially 

    在距离原子核一定距离后，发现电子的概率开始或多或少地呈指数下降

  - more or less exponentially差不多以指数级

  - it will approach zero,it will never actually hit zero.无限接近于0，事实上永远不会到达0。

- 第四遍：开弹幕开字幕，比照英文演讲稿跟着默读，补充一些第三遍没注意到的词汇。这一篇有很严重的连读，很多句子听不懂是因为连读，可能不仅需要记忆单词的发音，还要记忆一些连读的音，不然很干扰正常信息的获取。

  You probably know that all stuff is made up of atoms and that an atom is a really, really, really, really tiny particle. Every atom has a core, which is made up of at least one positively charged particle called a proton, and in most cases, some number of neutral particles called neutrons. That core is surrounded by negatively charged particles called electrons. The identity of an atom is determined only by the number of protons in its nucleus. Hydrogen is hydrogen because it has just one proton, carbon is carbon because it has six, gold is gold because it has 79, and so on. Indulge me in a momentary tangent. How do we know about atomic structure? We can't see protons, neutrons, or electrons. So, we do a bunch of experiments and develop a model for what we think is there. Then we do some more experiments and see if they agree with the model. If they do, great. If they don't, it might be time for a new model. We've had lots of very different models for atoms since Democritus in 400 BC, and there will almost certainly be many more to come. Okay, tangent over. The cores of atoms tend to stick together, but electrons are free to move, and this is why chemists love electrons. If we could marry them, we probably would. But electrons are weird. They appear to behave either as particles, like little baseballs, or as waves, like water waves, depending on the experiment that we perform. One of the weirdest things about electrons is that we can't exactly say where they are. It's not that（这里有连读） we don't have the equipment, it's that this uncertainty is part of our model of the electron. So, we can't pinpoint them, fine. But we can say there's a certain **probability**（这个词读的很快） of finding an electron in a given space around the nucleus. And that means that we can ask the following question: If we drew a shape around the nucleus such that we would be 95% sure of finding a given electron within that shape, what would it look like? Here are a few of these shapes. Chemists call them orbitals, and what each one looks like depends on, among other things, how much energy it has. The more energy an orbital has, the farther most of its density is from the nucleus. By they way, why did we pick 95% and not 100%? Well, that's another quirk of our model of the electron. Past a certain distance from the nucleus, the probability of finding an electron starts to decrease more or less exponentially, which means that while it will approach zero, it'll never actually hit zero. So, in every atom, there is some small, but non-zero, probability that for a very, very short period of time, one of its electrons is at the other end of the known universe. But mostly electrons stay close to their nucleus as clouds of negative charged density that shift and move with time. How electrons from one atom interact with electrons from another determines almost everything. Atoms can give up their electrons, surrendering them to other atoms, or they can share electrons. And the dynamics of this social network are what make chemistry interesting. From plain old rocks to the beautiful complexity of life, the nature of everything we see, hear, smell, taste, touch, and even feel is determined at the atomic level. 

- 第五遍：关弹幕，尽量闭眼听。感觉好很多，重点反复听了几次听不清楚的地方。

- 第六遍：2023-03-06 跟读。
