- 第一遍：不开弹幕，不开字幕，不按暂停。听不很懂，但是比前几集的情况好一点，但还是有大量的句子理解不了，只能听到零碎的片段。不能仅凭听而理解整个语段的意思。

- 第二遍：开英语字幕，不按暂停。跟上一篇一样，还是有大量的生词不认识，看着英文字幕都觉得吃力，更遑论听力了。我觉得还是得赶紧把词汇过一遍，不然听TED总是这样的情况。

- 第三遍：整理生词。

  - abduction，名词绑架

  - extraterrestrial，外星的，extraterrestrial Life 外星生物

  - pursuit ，名词，研究，工作

  - inhabited，adj，有人居住的。

  - mythical realms 神话世界

  - frozen or molten 冻结或熔化

  - habitable range 可居住范围

  - versatile 多面手的，多才多艺的

  - thrive vi 兴旺发达 茁壮生长

  - hydrothermal  水热的

  - fatal 危险的，**不是faitou而是feitou**

    视频1:29处： Life is found everywhere, from black smoke of hydrothermal vents（出口） in the dark depths of Earth's oceans, to bubbling, hot, acidic
    springs on the flanks of volcanoes, to high up in the atmosphere **最难的一个句子**

    从地球海洋黑暗深处的热液喷口冒出的黑烟，到冒泡的、热的、酸性的火山侧翼的泉水，在大气中。

    这个句子首先是各种生词，然后是vents后的in the dark直接连在一起，最后是hot acidic spring这几个词也连在一起。

  - radiation，辐射

  - salinity, acidity, and limited availability of sunlight, water, or oxygen 盐度、酸度和有限的阳光、水或氧气

  - mimic  模仿  

  - an impact crater  撞击坑

  - Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, and Enceladus and
    Titan, two of Saturn's moons 木卫二，木星的卫星之一，土卫二和土卫六，土星的两颗卫星

  - so these rivers may instead be flowing with liquid hydrocarbons such as **methane and ethane**  因此，这些河流可能与液态碳氢化合物（如**甲烷和乙烷**）一起流动 
  
- 第四遍：重听。









We've all seen movies about terrible insects from outer space or stories of abduction by little green men, but the study of life
in the universe, including the possibility of extraterrestrial life, is also a serious, scientific pursuit. Astrobiology draws on
diverse fields, such as physics, biology, astronomy, and geology, to study how life was formed on Earth, how it could form
elsewhere, and how we might detect it. Many ancient religions described other worlds inhabited by known human beings, but
these are more like mythical realms or parallel universes than other planets existing in the same physical world. It is only
within the last century that scientists have been able to seriously undertake the search for extraterrestrial life. We know that
at the most basic level organisms on Earth need three things: liquid water, a source of energy, and organic, carbon-based
material. We also know that the Earth is just the right distance from the Sun, so as not to be either frozen or molten. So, planets
within such a habitable range from their own stars may be able to support life. But while we used to think that life could only
exist in such Earth-like environments, one of the most amazing discoveries of astrobiology has been just how versatile life is.
We now know that life can thrive in some of the most extreme environments that'd be fatal for most known organisms. Life
is found everywhere, from black smoke of hydrothermal vents in the dark depths of Earth's oceans, to bubbling, hot, acidic
springs on the flanks of volcanoes, to high up in the atmosphere. Organisms that live in these challenging environments are
called extremophiles, and they can survive at extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation, as well as salinity, acidity, and limited availability of sunlight, water, or oxygen. What is most remarkable about these extremophiles is that they are found thriving in environments that mimic those on alien worlds. One of the most important of these worlds is our red and dusty
neighbor, Mars. Today, astrobiologists are exploring places where life might once have existed on Mars using NASA's
Curiosity rover. One of these is Gale Crater, an impact crater created when a meteor hit the surface of Mars nearly 3.8 billions
years ago. Evidence from orbit suggest past traces of water, which means the crater might once have supported life. Planets
are not the only places astrobiologists are looking at. For example, Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, and Enceladus and
Titan, two of Saturn's moons, are all exciting possibilities. Although these moons are extremely cold and two are covered in
thick ice, there is evidence of liquid oceans beneath the shell. Could life be floating around in these oceans, or could it be
living around black smoker vents at the bottom? Titan （发音taiten）is particularly promising as it has an atmosphere and Earth-like lakes, seas, and rivers flowing across the surface. It is very cold, however, too cold for liquid water, so these rivers may instead be flowing with liquid hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane. These are composed of hydrogen, and, more importantly,carbon, which is the basic building block of all life as we know it. So, could life be found in these lakes? Although instruments are being designed to study these distant worlds, it takes many years to build them and even longer to get them where they need to be. In the meantime, astrobiologists work in our own natural laboratory, the Earth, to learn about all the weird and wonderful forms of life that can exist and to help us one day answer one of humanity's oldest questions: Are we alone?
